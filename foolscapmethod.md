The Foolscap Method

stolen from Steven Pressfield who stole it from Norm Stahl.

## Deicde three acts

## Decide Narration

How the story is told told. Do you tell it real-time, or is it reflection. Do you tell it from Atticus' perspective or Scout's?

## Theme 

What is this thing about? Maybe have to write it to figure this out. 

## Inciting incident -- climax

> The inciting incident in any story also implies, imbedded in it, is the climax. From the minute Apollo Creed picks Rocky, we know the climax is going to be ‘Rocky fights Apollo Creed’. So if you can take your story, whatever is floating around in your head, and find out what is the inciting incident and then what is the climax, you have a spine all the way through that story. If you think that this is formula or too predictable, I’ll take you back to The Iliad, to Homer and 950 BC.
